# Introduction

This Statamic addon provides an out of the box solution for adding a members area or member restricted content to your site, building on Statamic’s existing user management and user form tags. It also provides a self-contained members section in the control panel, allowing you to manage members independently of other users.

> **Important:** This addon uses Statamic’s multi-user features, which are Pro only. Therefore this addon will only work with the Pro edition.
